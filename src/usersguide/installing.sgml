The netperf Roll must be installed during the Frontend installation step
of your cluster (refer to section 1.2 of the Rocks usersguide).
Future releases will allow the installation of the netperf Roll onto a
running system.

The netperf Roll is added to a Frontend installation in exactly the same
manner as the required HPC Roll.  Specifically, after the HPC Roll is
added the installer will once again ask if you have a Roll (see
below).  Select 'Yes' and insert the netperf Roll.
